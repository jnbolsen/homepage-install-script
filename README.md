# Homepage install and update scripts
These are scripts to easily install and update [Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/installation/) from source.

sudo apt install curl node.js npm
```

```

These scripts are similar to the LXC Homepage scripts from [Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=homepage), but tailored for my personal use and used within the server instead of Proxmox.
